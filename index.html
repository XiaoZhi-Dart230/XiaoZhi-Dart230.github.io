        <strong>The King's Last Journey</strong><br><br></p>
        <br>
        
        <p style="font-size:x-large; text-align: center;">
            I <em>followed</em> my <strong>map</strong> that shows me the way, 
            It radiates brilliance, <em>shining like a</em> <strong>guiding beacon.</strong><br><br><br>
            
            I am well <strong>acquainted with Death.</strong>
            I have <strong>no fear of him</strong>, so my soul stubbornly <em>presses on</em>.<br><br><br>
            
            I fight death like a child fights aging. <strong>The end is near, 
            I walk peacefully,</strong> <em>relying only</em> on myself.<br><br><br>
            
            <strong>I was a once soldier. I've seen death before.</strong> 
            I <em>have</em> to keep my mind clear and not be disturbed by anything.<br><br><br>
            
            Death is inevitable. But I postpone it. <strong>Even steel breaks in the cold.</strong> 
            The road is long, the journey is long.<br><br><br>
            
            <strong>After the darkest night, the sun shines brightest.</strong> 
            The darkest night <em>will</em> usher in the brightest dawn.<br><br><br>
            
            I <em>have</em> <strong>become like steel.</strong> 
            The wounds do not bother me but give me a little strength.<br><br><br>
            
            <strong>Blood flows in the soil. The petals must wither. </strong>
            The soul blooms <em>like</em> a wild flower after the fire.<br><br><br>
            
            On the <strong>mountain appeared the nameless field</strong> I longed for. 
            Along the field, I saw a flame that looked like hope <em>burning</em>.<br><br><br>
            
            <strong>A pair of murderous eyes.</strong> Use them <em>to</em> help us achieve victory. 
            Strength is the gift of the <strong>fearless</strong>. It always <em>will</em> be so.<br><br><br>
            
            I have <strong>sacrificed so much</strong>, and now I <em>will</em> take it all back. 
            The glorious end is near. Go forward, my friend. To victory.<br><br><br>
