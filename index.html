    <h1 style="text-align: center;">The King's Last Journey</h1>
    <br>
    
    <p style="text-align: center;">I <em>followed</em> my <strong>map</strong> that shows me the way, 
        It radiates brilliance, shining like a <strong> guiding beacon.</strong></p>
    <br>
        
    <p style="text-align: center;">I am well acquainted with Death. 
        I have no fear of him, so my soul stubbornly presses on.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p style="text-align: center;">I fight death like a child fights aging. The end is near, 
        I walk peacefully, relying only on myself.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p style="text-align: center;">I was a once soldier. I've seen death before. 
        I have to keep my mind clear and not be disturbed by anything.</p>
    <br>
        
    <p style="text-align: center;">Death is inevitable. I just postpone it. Even steel breaks in the cold. 
        The road is long, the journey is long.</p>
    <br>
        
    <p style="text-align: center;">After the darkest night, the sun shines brightest. 
        The darkest night will usher in the brightest dawn.</p>
    <br>
        
    <p style="text-align: center;">I have become like steel. The wounds do not bother me but give me a little strength.</p>
    <br>
        
    <p style="text-align: center;">Blood flows in the soil. The petals must wither. The soul blooms like a wild flower after the fire.</p>
    <br>
        
    <p style="text-align: center;">On the mountain appeared the nameless field I longed for. Along the field, I saw a flame that looked like hope burning.</p>
    <br>
        
    <p style="text-align: center;">A pair of murderous eyes. Use them to help us achieve victory. 
        Strength is the gift of the fearless. It always will be so.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p style="text-align: center;">I have sacrificed so much, and now I will take it all back. 
        The glorious end is near. Go forward, my friend. To victory.</p>
